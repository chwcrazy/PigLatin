A VERY Simple Pig Latin Translation Microservice


Introduction
----------------------------------
A flask-based microservice to translate english text to pig latin.


Game Introduction
----------------------------------
Pig Latin is a language game in which words in English are altered. The objective is to conceal the words from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to Latin is a deliberate misnomer, as it is simply a form of jargon, used only for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language.
